                <h3> Are People the Weakest Link in Security? Absolutely.</h3>
                <h4>Phishing, Emails, Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>When thinking about cyber security, people might think that the weakest link is a technical vulnerability or a firewall vulnerability. However, in workplace environments, the weakest link in security is the people in an organization. People are the weakest link for a few reasons. For one, they often fall prey to the most common type of cyber attack; phishing attacks. After working for a few years in IT in the email department, I dealt with hundreds of phishing attacks, and worked with the users that had been scammed. While the result was often them losing money, it also resulted in users losing their usernames and passwords many times. This is an easy way for hackers to harvest login credentials. Depending on how much access this user had, the malicious actors could then use their credentials to access sensitive data or internal applications. While technical vulnerabilities can be patched, it takes time and money to train employees to be security-minded.

                <h3>How Important is Cybersecurity in K-12 IT?</h3>
                <h4>K12, Education, Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>
                    In different environments, adhering to proper security protocols are more important than others. For a hospital, it is critical to safeguard patient data and to prevent cyber ransom attacks from bringing operations to a standstill. People's lives are literally at stake. For a personal Minecraft server with friends, it might not be as important to have everything industry-standard. How about when it comes to educational environments, such as a public school system? On one hand, it is critically important to ensure that student data is kept secure. Like a hospital, it is very important that schools are able to stay open no matter what, and that they are not stopped due to a cyber attack. However, unlike other environments, public schools often do not have the funding that they need to do everything properly. Corners are cut, and many responsibilities often fall to an understaffed IT department. It is important that cyber security be kept in mind when creating a school budget, however it can be very difficult to advocate for the funding needed when funding is needed desperately by every department.
